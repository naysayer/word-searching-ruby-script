I once made a remark about hidden books of the Bible (merely by fluke). It kept people looking so hard for the facts and for others it was a mere revelation. Some were in a jam, especially since the names of the books were not capitalized. By now the truth finally struck home to the numbers of readers. To others it was a real job. We want it to be a most fascinating few moments for you. Yes, there will be some very difficult ones for you to spot. Others may require judges to help them. I will quickly admit it usually takes a minister to find one of them. There will be loud lamentations when it is fond. A little lady says she brews a cup of tea so she can concentrate better. See how well you can compete. Relax now for there are sixteen names of the Bible hidden in this paragraph. One preacher found fifteen books in twenty minutes but took him three weeks to find the sixteenth one.
